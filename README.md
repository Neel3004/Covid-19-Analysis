# Covid-19-Analysis

The data is taken from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

This analysis is done with the help of various sql commands and manipulation techniques like CRUD Operations, CTE's and Window functions. This operations help answer certain questions like highest deaths, highest infections, death percents corresponding to certain location,country and many other.

Additionally, I created a few visualizations in Tableau for better analysis and to derive insights like what is the global death percentage, how covid has affected different countries, and how is the distribution among continents.
